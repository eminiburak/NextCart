# NextCart

A minimal eâ€‘commerce demo built with Next.js App Router, NextAuth, and Tailwind CSS. It fetches products from FakeStoreAPI and demonstrates server components, dynamic imports, client state via localStorage, and image optimization with `next/image`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (or the version supported by your environment)
- A `.env.local` file with the following variables for auth and Firebase Admin:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_strong_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=service_account_email@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

## Getting started

1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2) Create `.env.local` in the project root and fill in the variables above.

3) Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```
## What's included

- App Router (`src/app/*`) with route groups for home, products, cart, profile, auth
- Authentication with NextAuth (Google OAuth + credentials via Firebase Admin)
- Cart state persisted to `localStorage`
- Theme toggle (light/dark) with a background image that switches by theme
- Dynamic imports for client-heavy UI (`AuthButtons`, `ThemeToggle`) to reduce JS
- Error and loading boundaries (`src/app/error.js`, `src/app/loading.js`)
